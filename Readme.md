Gating_with_adatoms
===================

This is a Python program to visualize the electrostatic potential 
induced by charged defects on surfaces, as they are placed by the user.

The graphical user interface is a Matplotlib figure which is able to handle events
like mouse clicks and mouse movements.

It has been tested in Python 2.7.6 and Python 3.4.2.

For the moment, the program deals only with the case of adatoms adsorbed on 
the vacancy sites of the 2x2 reconstruction of the InAs(111)A semiconductor surface. 

For a detailed explanation on the physics behind this, see the articles:
